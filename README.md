# Task
Recreate the simple linear regression notebook and add apprioprate comments to explain what each line is doing or meant to accomplish.

### Notebook Contents:
- **Data Preparation:**
    1. Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
    2. Load the dataset.
    3. Check for missing values and handle if needed.
    4. Explore the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.


- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    1. Visualize the relationship between the predictor and target variables.
    2. Check for linearity and identify any outliers or anomalies.

- Data Splitting:
    1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., using train_test_split from sklearn).


- Model Training:

1. Import the linear regression model from sklearn.
2. Fit the model to the training data.


- Model Evaluation:

1. Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).


- Visualization:

1. Plot the regression line along with the actual and predicted values.
2. Visualize any patterns or discrepancies between the actual and predicted values.
